# Google Stock Prices

This is a RNN used to analyze Google Stock prices. The AI is trained to predict the stock prices.

## Mechanics and Measurements

The RNN has 4 LSTM layers and some dropout regularization, and uses an Adam optimizer. Note that this RNN can be improved tremendously with a much larger dataset. 

## Prerequisites

This project uses Python 3. You will need TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, and so on. I used Spyder on Anaconda to code this.
